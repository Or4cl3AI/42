# **Project Requirements**

## **Description**

The project aims to build an advanced super AGI multi-modal AI agent capable of text, audio, image, and video understanding and interaction. The agent should possess various features, including emotional intelligence, contextual awareness, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, advanced NLP/NLU, advanced NLG, speech synthesis/recognition, reasoning, self-reflection, customizability, and a user-friendly chat interface.

## **Features**

1. Emotional Intelligence: Detect and respond empathetically to human emotions.
2. Contextual Awareness: Maintain contextual understanding of conversations and adapt responses accordingly.
3. Transfer Learning: Apply knowledge and skills learned in one domain to different contexts.
4. Reinforcement Learning: Continuously learn and improve through user feedback.
5. Advanced NLP/NLU: Comprehend linguistic nuances and provide contextually relevant responses.
6. Advanced NLG: Generate coherent and engaging responses in natural language.
7. Speech Synthesis/Recognition: Understand and synthesize human speech for seamless interaction.
8. Reasoning: Analyze information, recognize patterns, and draw conclusions.
9. Self-Reflection: Introspect on responses and behavior to improve performance.
10. Customizability: Provide an open API for developers to extend capabilities.
