```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
```

This code generates the routes file for a minimal working Laravel web application. It defines a single route that maps the root URL ("/") to a closure function that returns the "welcome" view.
